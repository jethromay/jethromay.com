        </h1>
    </header>

    <p>My name is Jethro May, I am a full-stack web developer & writer living and working in South Africa.</p>

    <p>I started coding in 2013 and I have been hooked since! I have worked with a wide range of technologies but I am strongest within the PHP and Laravel ecosystems, which I have a <strong>strong</strong> passion for. </p>

    <p>I am also passionate about open source, front-end development, <a href="/posts" class="text-blue-700">writing</a> and travelling.</p>

            <p class="leading-normal">
                This is my main development machine which I use for the majority of my work. I do not need for a desktop machine these days, I can work from anywhere.

            </p>
            <p class="leading-normal">
                Having used many IDE's over the years, nothing comes close to the sheer power of PHPStorm. I do however use VSCode for a few projects that require features that PHPStorm doesn't provide.

            </p>
            <p class="leading-normal">
                I recently made the switch from Homestead to Valet and i haven't looked back. It is a minimal development environment which suits my needs.

            </p>
            <p class="leading-normal">
                I currently use Docker for my WordPress projects, I tend to use the same structure for each project, so this allows me to quickly spin up and reuse the same environment.

            </p>
            <p class="leading-normal">
                I predominantly use this app when I need to interact with my databases, this tends to service most of my needs but I still find some use in TablePlus.

            </p>
            <p class="leading-normal">
                Sequel Pro was my go-to database management tool for some time but when I tried out TablePlus I fell in love. It is extremely easy to use, visually appealing and the features are fantastic.

            </p>
            <p class="leading-normal">
                Nothing comes close to iTerm2, it is a personal favourite and one of the first things that get installed when setting up a new machine.

            <p class="leading-normal">
                I only recently started using Alfred and it has been a game-changer, I cannot imagine working without it.

                Over the years I have used GitLab, Bitbucket and GitHub for various projects. These days all of my public and private repositories sit on GitHub.
