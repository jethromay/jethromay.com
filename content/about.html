            About
        </h1>
    </header>

    <p>Hey! My name is Jethro May and I currently work full time as a full-stack PHP developer in sunny South Africa. I am passionate about building the web, open-source projects and sharing my knowledge with others.</p>

    <p>My coding journey began in the early stages of 2013, when I made the switch from the music industry and decided to focus on programming.</p>

    <p>I have been building websites and applications for the past 7 years, where I have been exposed to a variety of different languages and frameworks. I am extremely passionate about PHP and more specifically the Laravel and WordPress ecosystems where I spend a lot of my time.</p>

    <p>
        When I am not coding I enjoy spending time with my friends and family, keeping fit and travelling.
    </p>

                This is my main development machine which I use for the majority of my work. Its surprisingly fast and extremely portable.

                I used PHPStorm for many years but after purchasing Caleb Porzio's course, <a class="font-bold underline text-blue-700" href="https://makevscodeawesome.com/">Make VS Code Awesome</a> I made the switch and haven't looked back.

            </p>
            <p class="leading-normal">
                Laravel Valet provides me with a minimal and extremely fast environment for my projects.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li class="mb-6">

            </p>
            <p class="leading-normal">
                I currently use Docker for some of my WordPress projects, I tend to use the same structure for each project, so this allows me to quickly spin up and reuse the same environment.

            </p>
            <p class="leading-normal">
                I predominantly use this app when I need to interact with my databases, this tends to service most of my needs but I still find some use in TablePlus.

            </p>
            <p class="leading-normal">
                I recently started using HELO for email testing and debugging, it makes this usually painful process across a variety of environments extremely easy.

            <p class="leading-normal">
                <a class="font-bold underline text-blue-700" href="https://tableplus.com/">TablePlus</a>
            </p>
            <p class="leading-normal">
                Sequel Pro was my go-to database management tool for some time but when I tried out TablePlus I fell in love. It is extremely easy to use, visually appealing and the features are fantastic.

            </p>
            <p class="leading-normal">
                Nothing comes close to iTerm2, it is a personal favourite and one of the first things that get installed when setting up a new machine.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p class="leading-normal">
                I only recently started using Alfred and it has been a game-changer, I cannot imagine working without it.

            <p class="leading-normal">
                Over the years I have used GitLab, Bitbucket and GitHub for various projects. These days all of my public and private repositories sit on GitHub.
